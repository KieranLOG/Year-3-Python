#The definition of a variable is:
#A named location
#in a computer's memory
#that stores a value
#the value can change

#The definition of a CONSTANT is:
#A named location
#in a computer's memory
#that stores a value
#the value SHOULD NOT be changed

#An example of a variable is:
pie = "pumpkin"
#This could be changed to:
pie = "apple"
#Because variables CAN change

#An example of a CONSTANT is:
PI = 3.14
#This CANNOT change

#Here are more examples of CONSTANTS:
FREETHROW = 1
DUNKSHOT = 2
THREEPOINTER = 3
#Constants are always written in CAPITALS

#No matter what...
#Freethrows will always be 1 point
#Dunkshots will always be 2 points
#Threepointers will always be 3 points
